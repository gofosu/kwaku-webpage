abstract = "We examine whether opportunities for civic engagement mediate the effect of access to education on political violence. In fragile states solely providing access to education may be necessary but not sufficient to reduce violence because it can generate unintended political and economic grievances against the government. We argue that further providing opportunities for civic participation should help youths to learn to use and trust nonviolent channels contribute productively to their communities and address their grievances, minimizing the risk of violence. To test our argument, we leverage a unique education program implemented in partnership with the Government of Somalia and original data from a survey of 800 young people and qualitative interviews. The results provide support for our hypotheses and offer new empirical evidence that civic engagement opportunities can mediate the impact of government provision of education in promoting political stability in fragile states."
