abstract = "Partisans rarely vote for opposition party candidates. In contrast to existing work on cross-party voting in developing countries, I argue that two critical constituency-level factors *jointly* shape a partisan's likelihood of voting for a candidate from the other party when desirous of more public infrastructure. The first is *partisan geography*: partisans have an incentive to vote for a similar or better opposition politician when they live side by side with her supporters in a community (i.e., partisan nonsegregated areas)  because politicians cannot exclude them from the provided benefits. Second, voters only have an incentive to cross party lines in \textit{competitive} electoral districts because their vote can be pivotal in selecting and sanctioning an opposition politician. I find support for my hypothesis and proposed explanation using data from a conjoint experiment alongside survey responses of citizens located in a stratified, representative sample of electoral districts in Ghana. The findings help explain seemingly contradictory results in the literature by showing that partisans are willing to cross party lines in specific electoral settings."
