abstract = "Politicians often rely on local brokers who use material inducements, physical intimidation, or threats to generate votes. Brokers also make public endorsements in support of political candidates.  We assess the causal effect of endorsements on vote choice using an experimental design that randomly exposed voters to real endorsements made by one type of non-partisan elite actor - traditional chiefs - during Ghana's 2020 election campaign. Our design allows us to assess how endorsements operate by considering whether they influence voters via cooperative or coercive channels. This distinction is important, because if chiefs use endorsements coercively, it can undermine democratic accountability and discourage politicians from developing programmatic policies. Our results demonstrate that endorsements substantially affect vote choice, especially among non-copartisan voters and those who have positive evaluations of the endorser. The impact of endorsements operates through cooperative channels: voters update their beliefs based on the expected performance of the endorsed candidate."
