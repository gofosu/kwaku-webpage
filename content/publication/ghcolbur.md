abstract = "Bureaucracies vary in the extent to which hiring is meritocratic versus patrimonial and patronage-driven. This variation depends in part on the preferences and social proximity to local populations of political leaders vis-à-vis bureaucrats. Colonial and other forms of external and peripheral state-building typify cases where bureaucrat-led patrimonialism is likely to prevail due to political leaders’ low social proximity and relative ambivalence over hiring. Digitizing individual-level bureaucratic records across six decades of British rule in Ghana, we find significant ethnic bias in African hiring despite British claims of meritocracy. We suggest this resulted from initial African bureaucrats capturing hiring to favor their co-ethnics, with post-independence leaders inheriting bureaucracies that were already ethnically-imbalanced. Our results demonstrate the agency of local bureaucrats in state-building and highlight conditions under which bureaucrats’ preferences, rather than political principals’, shape state institutions. They also challenge conventional wisdom about why newly-independent African states became “neopatrimonial.”"
