My research focuses on election integrity, democratic accountability, legislator behavior, and the political economy of development in Sub-Saharan Africa. I also work on issues of research design and transparency. 

In my book project, I use experimental and observational research methods to examine the effects of election quality on democratic responsiveness in developing countries. I show that politicians elected in high-quality elections exert more effort to satisfy constituents' demands for local public goods, but do change their attendance to parliamentary meetings. I argue that interventions such as election observation that limits opportunities for election-day fraud and violence, and encourage office-seeking politicians to substitute effort for election manipulation

My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the UK’s Department for International Development, the International Growth Center, and the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/people/george-ofosu/). It has been published in the British Journal of Political Studies and Electoral Studies. 
 
I was a predoctoral fellow (2015-2016) at Stanford’s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law and held a Hewlett Research Fellowship position at Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University in 2009-2010. I have also worked, as consultant for the National Democratic Institute, on domestic election observation efforts and parallel vote tabulations in Malawi (2009), Nigeria (2011) and Guinea (2015).
