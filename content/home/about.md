My research focuses on political accountability, election integrity, legislator behavior, and the quality of democracy, with a regional focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. I also work on issues of research design and transparency. Beginning July 2019, I will start as an Assistant Professor of Political Science in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science. 

My research has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the UK’s Department for International Development, the [International Growth Center](https://www.theigc.org/blog/impact-parliamentary-debates-ghanas-2016-elections/), and the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/people/george-ofosu/). It has been published or forthcoming in the American Journal of Political Science, British Journal of Political Science and Electoral Studies. 
 
I was a predoctoral fellow at Stanford’s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law (2015-2016) and previously held a Hewlett Research Fellowship position at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University (2009-2010). I have consulted for the National Democratic Institute on domestic election observation efforts and parallel vote tabulations in Malawi (2009), Nigeria (2011) and Guinea (2015).
