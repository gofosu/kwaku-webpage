My research focuses on political accountability, election integrity, legislator behavior, and the quality of democracy, with a regional focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. I also work on issues of research design and transparency. 

My research has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the UK’s Department for International Development, the [International Growth Center](https://www.theigc.org/blog/impact-parliamentary-debates-ghanas-2016-elections/), and the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/people/george-ofosu/). It has been published or forthcoming in the American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, British Journal of Political Science and Electoral Studies. 
 
I am [Democracy and Development fellow](https://www.cddgh.org/george-k-ofosu/) of Ghana Center for Democratic Development. I have held research fellowship positions at Washington University in St. Louis, Stanford’s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law (2015-2016) and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University (2009-2010). I have consulted for the National Democratic Institute on domestic election observation efforts and parallel vote tabulations in Malawi (2009), Nigeria (2011) and Guinea (2015).
